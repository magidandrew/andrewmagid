## Who am I?
I'm an undergrad at Columbia University studying math and computer science.

## What's this site for?
As of now, it's to show my work and share my musings.

I know for sure that this is a place where I will document some of my personal projects, write about relevant experiences I find shareworthy
(ex. participating in a competition), or the little scripts I code or program setups that take a 
frustratingly long time. 

In this last case, half of the reason is for my own reference and the other is to 
potentially help that one person who fell into the same exact problem as me.
(If I had this issue, surely, someone else must've stumbled into the same rut too).

## Why Worms and Coffee?
I wasn't kidding when I said the "two foods in my fridge". Our second fridge used to be
heavily under-utilized: it only held a carton of year old fishing worms and a 12-pack of 
La Colombe nitro brewed coffee (since I couldn't store either anywhere else). 

A more poetic explanation would be for my interest in security, hence the *computer* worms [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm)
and liking for coffee. The first explanation is quite literal and I think it's a lot funnier.

## I want to talk to you
Okay, okay, settle down. Feel free to reach out to me using the social media icons at the bottom of the site.
