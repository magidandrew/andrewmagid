I'm an undergrad at Columbia University studying math and computer science. 

This is a place for my projects, plans, and perspectives. The wild west for my thoughts: the frontier of what I can do, compared to what I want to do. Welcome to my headspace.

Now without being pretentious, this is my blog. Go to the [homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}/) for an outline of what's here.
